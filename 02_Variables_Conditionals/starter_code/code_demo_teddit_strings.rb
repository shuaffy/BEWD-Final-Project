#TEDDIT:  Strings - Student's File
#	Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
#	This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course.
#	Each lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator.
#	Lesson 4 we will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit.
#	But until then we will hard code stories.


#This code along demonstrates how to work with strings.
#Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Only run one version at a time so you can see the difference.



#Version 4 - Use string interpolation and escape characters, polish the output.

show_story_line 'hello title world', 4
